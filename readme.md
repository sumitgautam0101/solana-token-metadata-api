# Solana Token Metadata API

This script retrieves and decodes the metadata of a token on the Solana blockchain using its mint address. It returns a structured format, with token's name, symbol, URI, seller fee, creators, and more. You can use URI address from the metadata to fetch other details by simply making a get request.
